# KRAGEN
**K**nowledge **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration **EN**gine is a tool that combines knowledge graphs, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced prompting techniques to solve complex problems with natural language. KRAGEN converts knowledge graphs into a vector database and uses RAG to retrieve relevant facts from it. KRAGEN uses advanced prompting techniques: namely graph-of-thoughts (GoT), to dynamically break down a complex problem into smaller subproblems, and proceeds to solve each subproblem by using the relevant knowledge through the RAG framework, which limits the hallucinations, and finally, consolidates the subproblems and provides a solution. KRAGEN’s graph visualization allows the user to interact with and evaluate the quality of the solution’s GoT structure and logic.

KRAGEN will use your formatted data dump (ie Neo4j knowledge base relationships and node information), put it into a vector database using the open source Weaviate database, and deploy a custom Graph of Thoughts viewer using React. You will be able to ask it any question regarding the data, and perform elaborate graph like solutions to resolve your query. Through the viewer you will be able to vet the thought process of answering your question, limiting hallucination and managing the logic of the LLM.

## Installation

#### 1. Install Docker and NodeJS

If not already installed, installation of Docker is necessary to deploy the workflow that parses the knowledge base dump, vectorizes the data, and deploys/uploads the vectors onto a Dockerized Weaviate Database Server. 

Here are some links to get started on Docker:
  - [Official Docker Website Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/)
  - [Official Docker Installation for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

If not already installed, NodeJS is necessary to view KRAGEN in the browser.

  - [NodeJS Homepage](https://nodejs.org/en)

#### 2. Clone the repo and configure the .env file

Git clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/EpistasisLab/KRAGEN.git`

Rename the .env.sample to .env and enter in your OpenAI API Key.

#### 3. Run docker workflow and prime the Weaviate database

You will run the setup bash file targeting your data (we are using test.csv as an example). This will go through multiple steps ensuring that your knowledge graph data dump is properly formatted, vectorized, and uploaded to your local Weaviate Dockerized server.

`./kragen-setup.sh test.csv`

Please follow the format of test.csv and upload your own dataset. To generate our test.csv, we use the publicly accesible knowledge graph AlzKB (https://alzkb.ai/) as our resource. We have a Jupyter notebook in src/extract_data.ipynb to check out how we generated the csv using the public knowledge graph.

#### 4. Boot up KRAGEN!

Run the following to view the KRAGEN visualization tool on localhost:3000

`./kragen-gui.sh`

If you used the sample dataset, try asking "what genes are associated with caffeine?" and analyze the thought flow!

## Using KRAGEN

### Querying with KRAGEN:

- Access KRAGEN via the provided interface or command line.
- Enter your query or problem statement into the designated input field.
- KRAGEN utilizes its integrated knowledge graphs and RAG framework to process the query.
- Expect to receive a comprehensive solution or relevant information to your query.

### Understanding the Output:

- In the main area of the interface, explore the knowledge graph and the information retrieved by the RAG framework.
- Navigate through the nodes and connections to gain insights into the problem domain and the retrieved facts.
- Evaluate the thoughts generated by KRAGEN as it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.
- Assess the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved knowledge and how it contributes to the final solution.

### Query History:

- Use the query history tab on the left to revisit past queries and solutions.
- Access previous interactions to review or build upon previous findings.
- Leverage the query history feature to maintain continuity in problem-solving or knowledge exploration sessions.
